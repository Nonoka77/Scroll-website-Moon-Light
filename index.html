        <h2 id="sec-title">What does the moon light?</h2>
        <p class="sec-contents">
            The intensity of moonlight varies greatly depending on the lunar phase, but even the full Moon typically
            provides only about 0.05–0.1 lux
            illumination.
            When a full Moon around perigee (a "supermoon") is viewed around upper culmination from the tropics, the
            illuminance can reach up to 0.32
            lux.From Earth,
            the apparent magnitude of the full Moon is only about 1⁄380,000 that of the Sun. </p>
        <p class="sec-contents"> The color of moonlight, particularly around full moon, appears bluish to the human eye
            compared to most artificial
            light sources due to the Purkinje effect.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-contents">
            The Moon's bond albedo is 0.12, meaning only 12% of incident sunlight is reflected from the lunar surface.
            Moonlight takes approximately 1.26 seconds to reach Earth's surface. Scattered in Earth's atmosphere,
            moonlight generally increases the brightness of the night sky, reducing contrast between dimmer stars and
            the background. For this reason, many astronomers usually avoid observing sessions around full moon.</p>
        <p class="sec-contents">In folklore, moonlight sometimes has a harmful influence. For example, sleeping in the
            light of a full Moon on certain nights was said to transform a person into a werewolf. The light of the Moon
            was thought to worsen the symptoms of lunatics,and to sleep in moonlight could make one blind, or
            mad.Nyctalopia (night blindness caused by a lack of vitamin A) was thought to be caused by sleeping in
            moonlight in the tropics. "Moon blindness" is a name for equine recurrent uveitis. Moonlight is no longer
            thought of as the cause. In the 16th century, moonmilk, a soft white limestone precipitate found in caves,
            was thought to be caused by the rays of the Moon.</p>
